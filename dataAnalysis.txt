Descriptive Analysis:

	It is to describe a set of data and not to make any kind of discition out of that.

	This is commonly applied to census data.

	The description and interpretation are different steps.

	The desciption of the data can not be generalized without additional statistical modeling.

	This could also be seen as putting data in the form of graph/picture which would describe how the data(subject) varied wrt to other parameter.

Exploratory Analysis:

	Its goal is to find relationships (that is unknown) between data and parameters on which the data was collected.
